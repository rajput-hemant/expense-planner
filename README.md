# expense-tracker

## About

> 💹 A flutter app that keeps track of your personal expenses and shows the last week's expenses.

## 👨‍🎓 Things I learned from this project

### 1. Flutter Fundemntals

- Composing UI from built-in and custom Widgets
- Custom Widgets are also composed from built-in and other custom Widgets
- Styling and configuring via arguments
- Use the docs & IDE support!

### 1. Styling & Configuring Widgets

- Styling & layout options are very different
- Different widgets can get the job done

### 3. Theming

- Defining a global theming and text
- Built-in widgets use Theme settings automatically

### 4. Business logic

- Lifting state up and use stateful widgets only when needed
- Passing functions references and data around
- Adjusting the UI to your logic
